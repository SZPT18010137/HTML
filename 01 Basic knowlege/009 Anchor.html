        Electronic circuits form a mostly invisible part of the world
        we live in today. These circuits are present in microchips or
        just “chips”, which combine the latest advances in performance,
        intelligence and, efficiency. Hundreds or thousands of these
        chips are integrated into each of the millions and billions of
        electronic devices people across the globe interact with every
        day. It is in this unseen realm that STMicroelectronics creates
        the sparks that animate the products we use at any given moment.
        Our technology is found everywhere microelectronics makes a
        positive contribution to people’s lives. Chips from ST embedding
        the most advanced innovations are an essential part of products
        as diverse as cars and key fobs, giant factory machines and
        data center power supplies, washing machines and hard disks,
        and smartphones and toothbrushes. We help our customers make
        these devices more intelligent, more energy efficient, more
        connected, safer and more secure.
